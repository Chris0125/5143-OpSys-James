## Question 1

The three objectives of an operating system are:
1) The Ability to Evolve
2) Efficiency
3) Convenience

## Question 2

The kernal of an Operating System is the most frequently used functions of the operating system that remain in main memory.

## Question 3

Multiprogramming is a scheme where while one program is awaiting I/O or some other input or data, a second program (or third, or fourth) can run in the meantime.

## Question 4

A process is quite simply put, a program in execution. It is a unit of activity characterized by a single sequential thread of execution.

## Question 5

A process is quite simply put

## Question 6

1) Support of modular programming: Programmers should be able to define program
modules, and to create, destroy, and alter the size of modules dynamically.

2) Process isolation: The OS must prevent independent processes from interfering
with each otherâ€™s memory, both data and instructions.

3) Long-term storage: Many application programs require means for storing
information for extended periods of time, after the computer has been
powered down.

4) Automatic allocation and management: Programs should be dynamically
allocated across the memory hierarchy as required. Allocation should be
transparent to the programmer. Thus, the programmer is relieved of concerns
relating to memory limitations, and the OS can achieve efficiency by assigning
memory to jobs only as needed.

5) Protection and access control: Sharing of memory, at any level of the memory
hierarchy, creates the potential for one program to address the memory space
of another. This is desirable when sharing is needed by particular applications.
At other times, it threatens the integrity of programs and even of the OS itself.
The OS must allow portions of memory to be accessible in various ways by
various users.
